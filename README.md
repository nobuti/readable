# Readable

## Installation

It's recommendable to open two separate terminal windows, in order to run the server and client separately.

First af all, you need install dependencies for server and client. Assuming you are in the root folder:

```
cd server
yarn (or npm install)
cd ../client
yarn (or npm install)
```

Launch server the server in one tab:

```
  node server.js
```

Then launch the client in another tab:

```
  yarn start
```

Then open a browser and enter `http://localhost:3000`.

## Server

https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter

## Client

The project consists in a content and comments web application. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments. Also they will be able to sort posts and comments by votes (TOP), comments (POPULAR, only for posts) and by date (NEW).
