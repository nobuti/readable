# Readable

## Installation

It's recommendable to open two separate terminal windows, in order to run the server and client separately.

First af all, you need install dependencies for server and client. Assuming you are in the root folder:

```
cd server
yarn (or npm install)
cd ../client
yarn (or npm install)
```

Launch server the server:

```
  node server
```

Then launch the client:

```
  yarn start
```
